# Network_Analysis-Contact_Networks
This python code visualizes the contact network in particle systems at a snapshot in time.
It requires two input files T.txt and C.txt, that are generated from codes in the Particle_Dynamics
and Particle_Dynamics-Contact repositories. Attached is an image of a typical contact network of Brownian (Stochastic force)
particles with mild cohesion.
